  description: "You are on a world named ___, which is at once a utopia and dystopia. You are unlucky enough to be part of the quarter of society tossed down to the Refuse--an underground territory where the government deposits people to fend for themselves. There are no given resources or consumables and people are not expected to survive. 
You have been down here for as long as you can remember, living on scraps of trash and the strength of your community. Your guardian who took you in all those years ago has just died from a virus that could’ve been cured in minutes if you were above ground. 
You’ve heard the whispers of an uprising, a rebelling force. You’ve had enough. You want to set the playing field even and fight against the force that set you down here.
You decide it’s time to begin your training to not only change your life, but the fate of your entire community. Your training in the Refuse Rebel Force starts today."

      content: '“You ain’t gonna get anywhere putting sorry work like that in,” Instructor Narskin spits.
	You have just gotten through your first few weeks of training and everything hurts. You are starting to learn the basic history of your world and other lessons the instructors think you can handle.
	You have just finished a particularly grueling physical training. You are crouched on the floor made of hard, overlapping rock, head bent down, trying not to throw up from the consumable you foolishly ate beforehand.
	“Listen here, grunt,” Narskin says in a quieter tone, standing beside you and looking down, “we are here to change things. It’s going to take  a lot of pain to get there. You’re not longer allowed to laze the day away. Find your courage or get out.”
	Narskin drops a beat-up plastic jug of water next to you and walks away.
	“You ain’t doing so bad,” a red-haired young girl says to you as you reach for the water, “we’s all got to start somewhere.”
	She gives a long look as if appraising you. 
	“Name’s Patsy, by the way.”
	You tell her your name and hope that you’ve found an ally in this brutal arena.'

      content: '“Well, at least you’re showing up now,” Instructor Narskin barks, a thin smile on his cracked lips, “that’s good, real effort. You’re still doing horribly, but at least you’re trying.”
	You lean against a metal wall, sucking in air. At least you didn’t throw up this time. What do they expect when you’ve been malnourished your entire life? There’s only so many punches you can throw. Still, you feel your body adapting--slowly, but at least it’s trying.
	The routines are still a bewilderment to you with lessons of physical training to understanding society to breaking down a hacking terminal and every detail in between. You see others in the Groundforce, hardened with a furrow in their brow like they have a purpose set before them. But the Groundforce hasn’t been established that long, has it? You think that maybe you could get there soon if you could withstand more punishment to the mind and body.
	Patsy beckons you over and you trudge behind her to the mess hall, looking forward to some food. '

      content: “Well, well, well,” Instructor Narskin sneers, “you didn’t come in last place this time!”
	I came a few places ahead of last, you think to yourself. Though your lungs burn and your muscles ache, you know you are improving. Your fitness results prove it. You start to feel muscle where there was only skin and bone before. You can’t help a grin from creeping onto your face. You’re far from the best of the recruits, but no longer are you at the back of the pack. Those hours of training have made a significant impact. 
	“Don’t get a big head, now, grunt,” Narskin reminds you, “you still have a long way to go. You wanna make a difference in this place? Always work harder than the day before. We are thrown down here to die, all the odds are stacked against us--nobody expects us to survive, let alone rise above. That’s why we gotta push so far.”
	He looks as if he’s about to say something else, but closes his mouth. Patsy approaches you, her lip bloody and knuckles raw, and Narskin takes the opportunity to march off, something mulling in his mind. Patsy gives you a thumbs up and you clap her on the shoulder, thinking about how you could be better than today.

      content: '“Well done!” Instructor Narksin shouts to you as you finish the last push in your exercise.
	You feel like you’ve made a real difference in the last week or so. You regain your breath through measured breathing and shake out your legs. You’re still not the best, not by a few, but you now have considerably more control over your body. 
	“You know,” Narskin says, stepping over to you in his menacing boots, “I didn’t think you’d make it this far. I woulda pegged you for one of those sorry souls coming here for free food without wanting to put in the work. But, here you are, putting in that work. Sure, you’re eatin’ too” --he jabs pointed fingers at the muscle on your ribs-- “but I can’t say you don’t deserve it. Keep it up, grunt.”
	You think you see a glint of respect in the instructor’s eyes for the first time. You are starting to feel like you belong. You’ve learned how to use at least seven different kinds of weapons and are also picking up the art of manipulating others--with special help from Patsy who has caught on quickly to that skill. You think about the times you’ve wanted to give up and are grateful that somewhere deep within you, you found the resolve to keep going. '
  
  description: "LEVEL 2: You’re starting to get a feel for how things work around here. You’ve met almost all the other recruits (there aren’t many), and you know how to get to each training area. People have started to sit beside you in the mess hall and seem to view you as more than just a waste of time. You still aren’t close to “mission-ready,” as they call it, but that’s why you’re here, continuing hard work. 
It’s not just endless runs, strength routines, and grueling labor--you’ve been brought into a world full of intelligence of the outside world. You feel like you’re just on the surface, ready to burst through. 
Your body and mind are starting to feel different than ever before. You feel like you have an actual purpose now. "
